# System masonry api

## Informações para roda local a aplicação

All Masonry development is being test-driven, following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. This means that we write tests before we even implement the code, which helps us to ensure that the system is working correctly from the start. In addition, we are attentive to design standards and the creation of clean code, seeking a well-defined architecture and the use of good programming practices.

In this way, we are building Masonry solidly, reliably and with a focus on code quality and the satisfaction of Masonic lodge users.
